# Sentence Simplifier using Word Embeddings and Virtual Threads (Java)

This project is a Java-based command-line application that simplifies English sentences by replacing complex words with simpler alternatives from Google's top 1000 common words. It uses pre-trained word embeddings and cosine similarity to preserve the meaning of the sentence. The system is designed with modular object-oriented principles and is compatible with Java's virtual threads (Project Loom) for scalable, responsive execution.

## Features

- Text simplification using semantic similarity
- Cosine similarity calculation between word vectors
- Integration with Google-1000 common words list
- Support for pre-trained word embedding files (e.g., GloVe-style)
- Console-based interactive user interface
- File input/output handling for batch processing
- Designed with virtual thread support for future concurrency

## Technologies Used

- Java 19+ (for virtual thread support)
- Object-Oriented Design
- Word Embeddings
- Cosine Similarity
- File I/O and Console Interaction
